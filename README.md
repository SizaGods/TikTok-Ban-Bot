## Introduction

This Python script uses the `requests` library to interact with the TikTok API to report a user based on their ID. The functionality allows you to continuously send report requests to the API.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- requests
- json
- urllib (however, it's part of Python standard libraries)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Set Up the Code**:
   - The script requires identification about the user you want to report. When you run the script, you will be prompted to input the target user ID.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute the script in your Python environment. It will start to send report requests continuously to the TikTok API for the specified user ID.

3. **View the Response**:
   - Each response from the TikTok API will be printed in the terminal showing either success or error messages.

## How the Code Works

### Main Components

- **xor(string: str)**:
  - This function takes a string input and returns its XOR encoded hexadecimal representation, which is applied to some parameters as required by TikTok's API.

- **whisper Class**:
  - This class is responsible for handling the sign-in request. The `sign` method generates necessary headers with signatures required for authentication.

- **report() Method**:
  - This method prepares the parameters and headers for reporting a user based on the provided ID, and sends the request to the TikTok API.

### Sending Reports

- A `GET` request is made to the TikTok API using the constructed parameters and headers.
- A loop is created to continuously report the specified user until the script is stopped manually.

## Important Notes

- **Ethical Considerations**: Reporting users should be done responsibly and in accordance with TikTok's community guidelines. Misuse of this script may lead to consequences on your TikTok account or against the API's terms of service.
- **Avoid Excessive Requests**: Continuously sending requests may lead to your IP address being rate-limited or banned from accessing TikTokâ€™s services.
